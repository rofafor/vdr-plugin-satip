Requirements:

- Libcurl >= 7.36.0 - the multiprotocol file transfer library with RTSP support
  http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

- PugiXML - Light-weight, simple and fast XML parser for C++
  http://pugixml.org/
  or
  TinyXML - a simple, small, C++ XML parser
  http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/

- VDR >= 2.1.4 for scrambled channels

Description:

This plugin integrates SAT>IP network devices seamlessly into VDR.
You can use any SAT>IP channel like any other normal DVB channel for
live viewing, recording, etc. The plugin also features full section
filtering capabilities which allow for example EIT information to be
extracted from the incoming stream.

Installation:

tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-satip-X.Y.Z.tgz
make -C satip-X.Y.Z install

Configuration:

The plugin accepts a "--devices" (-d) command-line parameter defaulting
to one. This parameter defines how many simultaneous transponders can
be received, if there are available SAT>IP tuners.

The plugin accepts also a "--server" (-s) command-line parameter, that
can be used to manually configure one SAT>IP server, if autodetection
via UPnP somehow can't be used.

SAT>IP satellite positions (aka. signal sources) shall be defined via
sources.conf. If the source description begins with a number, it's used
as SAT>IP signal source selection parameter. Otherwise, the default
parameter is one:

S19.2E  Astra 1KR/1L/1M/2C
=> Signal source = 1

S19.2E  2
=> Signal source = 2

S19.2E  3 Astra 1KR/1L/1M/2C
=> Signal source = 3

Setup menu:

- Operating mode = off       If you want exclude all SAT>IP devices
                   low       from VDR's device handling, set this
                   normal    option to "off". Otherwise, if you want
                   high      to keep SAT>IP at a low priority when
                             selecting available devices, set this
                             option to "low". Similarly, the "high"
                             value prefers the SAT>IP over the local
                             DVB cards when selecting available devices.
- Enable EPG scanning = yes  If you want exclude all SAT>IP devices
                             from VDR's EIT background scanning, set
                             this option to "no".
- Disabled sources = none    If your SAT>IP servers don't have certain
                             satellite positions available you can
                             disable them via this option.
- Disabled filters = none    Certain section filters might cause some
                             unwanted behaviour to VDR such as time
                             being falsely synchronized etc. This option
                             allows creation of blacklists of ill-behaving
                             filters. If this option is set to a non-zero
                             value, the menu page will contain that many
                             "Disable filter" options which allow you
                             to disable the individual section filters.
                             Valid range: "none" = 0 ... 7
- [Red:Scan]                 Forces network scanning of SAT>IP hardware.
- [Yellow:Devices]           Opens SAT>IP device status menu.
- [Blue:Info]                Opens SAT>IP information/statistics menu.
- [Ok]                       Opens information menu of selected SAT>IP
                             device.

Information menu:

- [Red:General]              Opens the general information page.
- [Green:Pids]               Opens the pid statistics page.
- [Yellow:Filters]           Opens the section filter statistics page.
- [Blue:Bits/bytes]          Toggles between bits and bytes mode.

Notes:

- The stream id "-1" states about unsuccessful tuning. This might be a
  result of invalid channel parameters or lack of free SAT>IP tuners.

- SAT>IP specification 1.2 doesn't support DVB-C/DVB-C2 receivers yet,
  but DVB-C (KABEL>IP) is supported for Digital Devices Octopus Net
  devices.

- If the plugin doesn't detect your SAT>IP network device, make sure
  your setup doesn't have firewalled the UDP port 1900.

- Stream decryption requires a separate CAM plugin that works without
  direct access to any DVB card devices. The integrated CAM slot in
  Octopus Net devices isn't supported.
